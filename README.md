## My LudumDare-26 entry 

### Journal

#### 1:30pm 
	- I'm still brainstorming, but taking a break to just get the environment all set up and clean.
	
#### 4pm 
	- Got a generic state machine which will be used for UI, sub-game state and Actors
	- up next: add simple level map and a base actor for movement test
		- skipping any pathfinding for now, it can be added as a bonus if I'm a good code monkey

#### 5:30pm
	- Trying to keep things as data-oriented as possible without getting caught up on architecture too much.
		- the idea is that I get the code nailed down in the next couple of hours, then spend the remaining time on
		  art, music and balancing


### Notes

Theme this time is **Minimalist** which seems mightily redundant.

But hey, at least [we have someone to blame!](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/04/26/you-need-a-scapegoat/) (good on you klianc09 for taking the bullet and also reassuring everyone :)
