## My LudumDare-26 entry 

### Nothing to see here

I'm still brainstorming, but taking a break to just get the environment all set up and clean.



### Notes

Theme this time is **Minimalist** which seems mightily redundant.

But hey, at least [we have someone to blame!](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/04/26/you-need-a-scapegoat/) (good on you klianc09 for taking the bullet and also reassuring everyone :)
